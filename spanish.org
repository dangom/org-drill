* Spanish questions

** Greetings

# Simple cards. When each card is presented, all subheadings are collapsed, but
# the text under the topic's main heading remains visible.

*** Greeting 1                                       :drill:

Translate into Spanish:

**** Answer

*** Greeting 2                                       :drill:

** Grammar rules 1

# More simple cards -- here the question and answer are produced purely using
# cloze deletion of test in [square brackets], without the need to hide any
# subtopics (though they WILL still be hidden if present).

# If the text between the brackets contains a `|' character, everything after
# that character is considered to be a `hint', and will remain visible when the
# rest of the clozed text is hidden.

# Set the variable `org-drill-use-visible-cloze-face-p' to `t' if you want
# cloze-deleted text to be shown in a special face when you are editing org
# mode buffers.

*** Grammar Rule                                     :drill:

To form the plural of a noun ending in a consonant, add [-es] to the end.

*** Grammar Rule                                     :drill:

To make the plural of an adjective ending in [a stressed vowel or a consonant
other than -z], add /-es/.

** Grammar rules 2

# An example of a 'hide1cloze' card. One of the areas marked with square
# brackets will be hidden (chosen at random), the others will remain visible.

*** Grammar Rule                                     :drill:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: hide1cloze
    :END:

To form [an adverb] from an adjective, add [-mente] to the [feminine|gender]
form of the adjective.

** Vocabulary

# Examples of 'twosided' cards. These are 'flip cards' where one of the
# first 2 'sides' (subheadings) is presented at random, while all others stay
# hidden.

# There is another builtin card type called 'multisided'. These are like
# 'twosided' cards, but can have any number of sides. So we could extend the
# examples below by changing their type to multisided and adding a third
# subheading which contains an inline image.

** Verbs

[[Regular Verb: bailar][Below]] is an example of a complex drill item. The main item is itself a drill
item which tests your ability to translate 'bailar' to and from English (which
direction is chosen at random).

The item has several child items, some of which contain notes about the verb,
others of which are separate drill items relating to the verb. In this example,
all the child drill items test verb conjugation, and have the 'conjugate' card
type. Which tense to test is specified by the =VERB_TENSE= property in each item,
and the information about the verb is retrieved from the parent's
=VERB_INFINITIVE= and =VERB_TRANSLATION= properties.

Some of the conjugation items are empty -- this allows the user to past in
conjugations as they are learned.

Following this item is an [[Old Style Verb][example]] of the "spanish_verb" card type. This is not
as sophisticated or useful as the above example, but is intended to demonstrate
how a function can control which subheadings are visible when an item is
tested.

Below is an example of a card that tests the user's ability to translate random
whole numbers to and from a non-English language. For it to work correctly, you
must have the third party library [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/spell-number.el][spell-number.el]] installed and loaded.

The meaning of the item's properties is as follows:
- =DRILL_LANGUAGE=: any language recognised by spell-number.el. At the time of
  writing these include: catalan, danish, dutch, english-eur, english-gb,
  english-us, esperanto, finnish, french-fr, french-ch, german, italian,
  japanese, norwegian, portuguese-br, portuguese-pt, spanish and swedish.
- =DRILL_NUMBER_MIN= and =DRILL_NUMBER_MAX=: the range between which the random
  number will fall.


*** Random Number 20-99                                                  :drill:
